# AdvancedDataStructures
This repository implements two types of datastructures for the advanced datastructures course at KIT.

To compile simply run the build.sh script (or just the one line contained in it) and an application called "ads_programm" should be created.
This application can be used as described in the assignment -> "ads_programm [pd|rmq] eingabe_datei ausgabe_datei".

Requires C++ 11 or more recent!
Tested with Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS.
