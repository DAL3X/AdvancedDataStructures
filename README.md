# AdvancedDataStructures
This repository implements two types of datastructures for the advanced datastructures course at KIT.

To compile simply run the build.sh script (or just the one line contained in it) and an application called "ads_programm" should be created. (But it will throw a warning!)
This application can be used as described in the assignment -> "ads_programm [pd|rmq] eingabe_datei ausgabe_datei".

Requires GCC with C++ 11 or newer!
Tested with Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS.
